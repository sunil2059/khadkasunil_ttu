<form id="quiz" onsubmit="return showResults();">
      
	   <p>Q1:Parents bring their 10-day-old infant to the emergency department because of poor feed ing for the past two days. The infant is febrile and appears lethargic and irritable. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are taken for cul ture, and the infant is started on ampicillin and gentamicin. Laboratory culture of CSF reveals growth of gram-positive bacilli, with b-hemolysis on sheep blood agar.

  <p>Q5:A 47-year-old man presents with dysarthria and progressive muscle weakness of the bilateral upper and lower extremities in the absence of any history of neurologic disease or recent ill ness, weight loss, or trauma. Physical examina tion is notable for muscle atrophy and weak ness in all extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the upper extremities but are 3+ in the lower extremities; some fasciculations are present. Babinski’s sign is up-going bilater ally, and cranial nerves are intact. Laboratory and imaging studies are all within normal lim its. Which of the following would be expected on microscopic examination of the central ner vous system?</p>

  <p>Q6:A 26-year-old woman is brought to the hospital by ambulance after an automobile accident. She sustained no injuries in the collision but is adamant that she did not see the car that hit her from the side as it approached. On neu rologic examination she has bilateral visual f ield defects affecting nearly half of her lateral vision. On further questioning about recent changes in her health, she notes that she has not menstruated in 10 months. From which embryologic layer does this woman’s neoplasm most likely originate?</p>

  <input type="radio" name="Q6" value="Mesoderm"> Mesoderm<br>

  <p>Q7:A 15-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother after experiencing a first-time seizure. The thin-appearing girl has a heart rate of 55/min, signs suggestive of dehydration, and fine, velvety hair covering her arms and legs. The physician calculates her body mass index to be 16.4 kg/m². When the patient’s mother leaves the room for a moment, the patient admits to the physician that she has been feeling depressed recently and that for the past week she has been self medicating with normal daily doses of one of her friend’s antidepressant medications.

The patient denies any history of trauma, but states that he stayed home from work last week because of a fever accompanied by diarrhea. Neurologic examination demon strates the absence of reflexes in the lower ex tremities with no cranial nerve deficits. What is the best therapy for this patient’s condition?</p>

No other motor or hearing deficits are evident. Which parts of the central nervous system are involved in this patient?</p>

  <p>Q10:A 63-year-old homeless woman is brought to the emergency department (ED) by the po lice because she is disoriented and confused. On questioning the patient frequently forgets what she has been asked. She provides seem ingly plausible details of the events prior to her coming to the hospital, but her accounts are entirely inconsistent with the police report. On physical examination she is emaciated and has nystagmus and an unsteady gait. ED records indicate that she has presented multiple times in the past for alcohol withdrawal and alcohol related injuries. The lesion accounting for the patient’s signs and symptoms is located in which part of the brain</p>
